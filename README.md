# GitToSplunk

You can use this to analyze your git repository in splunk.
Inspired by the project code maat

# Why would I want this?
If you want to know more about your repository history, it'll be a good way to do so.
You can learn which parts of your code changes the most,
which part of your code are used by too many people,
which part of your code was used by people who no longer in your team,
and more...

# What is this?
It's a c# form app, that you give it a repository path, and it'll give you a log that you can copy right away to splunk.
